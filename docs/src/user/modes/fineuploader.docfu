## FineUploader mode ##

FineUploader mode is the easiest way to get started with a dependency-free FineUploader. This mode provides a customizable UI, drag and drop support, progress bars, status messages, a file list with color-coded status indicators, and other UI niceties. Most developers will likely opt to use FineUploader mode.

FineUploader mode is defined in the `qq.FineUploader` module in the code.  It inherits everything from [FineUploaderBasic](fineuploaderbasic.md).
