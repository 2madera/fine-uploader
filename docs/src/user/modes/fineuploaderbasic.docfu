## FineUploaderBasic mode

FineUploaderBasic mode offers all the features of regular FineUploader mode, but rather than make assumptions about the UI, allows the developer to explicitly define which elements in the DOM FineUploader should act upon. This opens the door for finely tuned integration between FineUploader and your existing application. Choose this mode if you need very tight control over your uploader's UI.

FineUploaderBasic mode is defined in the `qq.FineUploaderBasic` module in the code. This is the base module for Fine Uploader, and provides all functions that do not involve UI components.

FineUploaderBasic has a couple more options that need to be set than regular FineUploader mode.
